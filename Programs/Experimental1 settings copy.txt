Color variations:
    1.Red and Blue
    2.Yellow and Blue
    3.Red and Green
    4.Green and Blue
    The formar color is main color, the another color is background color.
    The luminance contrast was controlled to be 30% of the color (ΔE2000) contrast. For a red stimulus (RGB = (255, 0, 0)), we selected a blue counterpart (RGB = (48, 48, 255))

Stimuli:
    The first experiment: solid-color flicker.
    The second experiment: hollowed circular flicker.
    The third experiment: Moving shapes.
    The fourth experiment: Gray-scale gradients.

background color in experiment 1:
    1.Red and Blue = #802700
    2.Yellow and Blue = #278000
    3.Red and Green = #008027
    4.Green and Blue = #002780

Shapes in experiment 3: 
    1.Circle
    2.Square
    3.Triangle
    4.Star

Resolution: 3840 x 2160
Frequency: 3Hz
The times to repeat: 10 times

Duration: 
    Experiment 1: 5 seconds for Preparation + 5 seconds for flicker
    Experiment 2: 5 seconds for Preparation + 5 seconds for flicker
    Experiment 3: 5 seconds for Preparation + 5 times of each shape moving
    Experiment 4: 5 seconds for Preparation + 3 seconds + 3 seconds
